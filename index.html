                    <h2>A little bit about me...</h2>
                    <p>I am a web designer and developer based in Cincinnati, OH. I originally studied music performance and German in college, and still enjoy performing and cultural studies in my free time. After returning from an extended trip in Germany at the end of 2017, I decided to pursue my interests in technology and web development to supplement my musical pursuits. I am primarily self-taught, though I have a few years of expierence working with computers. To excellerate my learning, I have also taken a number of online courses in web development and digital design.</p> 
                    <p>Thanks to my background in vocal performance and foreign language studies, I have highly developed skills in areas such as presentation, communication, and creativity. I have excellent attention to detail and I love creating unique and creative products and solutions.</p>
                    <p>When I am not coding or creating new designs, you can typically find me reading books, singing and performing, practicing photography, enjoying long walks in nature, and researching the latest trends in technology. I believe in living life to its fullest and applying myself 100% to anything and everything that I do. </p>
